# Facial-Emotion-Recognition-Using-Deep-Learning

DeepFER is a deep learning–based facial emotion recognition system designed to accurately classify human emotions from facial images. The project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transfer Learning to recognize emotions such as happy, sad, angry, fear, neutral, disgust, and surprise in real time.

By combining modern computer vision techniques with neural network architectures, DeepFER aims to deliver high accuracy and efficient performance across diverse facial datasets.

This system has potential applications in:

Human–Computer Interaction

Mental Health Monitoring

Customer Experience Analysis

Smart Surveillance

Interactive AI Systems

# Project Motivation

Understanding human emotions is a key step toward building empathetic and intelligent systems. Traditional emotion recognition approaches relied on handcrafted features and rule-based methods, which struggled to generalize across real-world scenarios.

With the rise of deep learning—especially CNNs—facial emotion recognition has seen significant improvements. CNNs automatically learn meaningful visual features directly from images, making them highly effective for expression classification.

DeepFER builds on this progress by integrating:

Deep CNN architectures

Transfer learning from pretrained models

Data augmentation for better generalization

Fine-tuning for improved accuracy

The goal is to create a scalable and robust emotion recognition pipeline capable of real-time inference.

# Approach

The system uses:

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction

Transfer Learning to leverage pretrained models

Data Augmentation to reduce overfitting

Fine-tuning to adapt models to emotion-specific features

These techniques collectively help DeepFER achieve strong performance even with limited training data.

# Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of facial images categorized into seven emotion classes:

Emotion Categories

**Angry** – Expressions of anger

**Sad** – Expressions of sadness

**Happy** – Expressions of happiness

**Fear** – Expressions of fear

**Neutral** – Non-expressive faces

**Disgust** – Expressions of disgust

**Surprise** – Expressions of surprise

Each image is labeled accordingly and used to train and evaluate the model.

# Objectives

Build an accurate facial emotion classifier

Achieve real-time prediction capability

Improve robustness using augmentation and transfer learning

Enable practical deployment for emotion-aware applications
